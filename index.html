        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>HTML Structure:</strong> A main container 'game-container' holds all game elements, with separate divs for the story, question, and choices. A button is used for game progression, and an image element displays ending scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>CSS Styling:</strong> Emphasis on a clean, modern layout with responsive design. The game uses appealing color schemes and typography, with interactive and engaging styles for buttons and images.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>JavaScript Logic:</strong> The game stages and endings are managed using an array-based structure. Dynamic content rendering updates the game based on player choices, with correct logic handling game progression and displaying appropriate endings.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong> Dynamic content updating was achieved through careful JavaScript coding and testing. Responsive design was crucial for a good user experience across devices, and a balance between aesthetic design and usability was key for engaging gameplay. Regular debugging and testing ensured a smooth, error-free experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Insights Gained:</strong> Planning the game structure and narrative early was invaluable. Adopting a user-centric approach in design and functionality enhanced the gameplay experience. Flexibility and adaptability during development led to a better end product.
